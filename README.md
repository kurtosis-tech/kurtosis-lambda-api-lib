Kurtosis Lambda API LIB 
=======================

### What's a Lambda?
A Kurtosis Lambda is a package of code with a connection to [the Kurtosis engine](https://docs.kurtosistech.com/) that runs inside the Kurtosis environment. You can think of a Lambda like a language-agnostic library, which allows for tests to be written in seconds from preexisting components. For more details in Lambdas, see [these docs](https://docs.kurtosistech.com/lambdas.html).
