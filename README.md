Kurtosis Module API LIB 
=======================

### What's a module?
A Kurtosis module is a package of code with a connection to [the Kurtosis engine](https://docs.kurtosistech.com/) that runs inside the Kurtosis environment. You can think of a module like a language-agnostic library, which allows for tests to be written in seconds from preexisting components. Simple modules might only have an "execute" command, while more complex modules might respond to multiple commands.

For more details on modules, see [these docs](https://docs.kurtosistech.com/lambdas.html).
